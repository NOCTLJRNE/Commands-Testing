## :information_source: My profile and background

You can find my full background & profile on linkedin [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bao-an-pham-ho-b04814a3/. In short, I'm an electrical engineer who is currently working in France. After 3 years working for CEA (a French public government-funded research organisation), I decided to learn how to become a blockchain developper. 


## :question: Why vote for me ?

I'd like to focus on developping blockchain dapps. I've already deployed a few dapps on Ethereum Ropsten testnet. I'm also interrested in Komodo's crypto conditions (CC), but didn't really have the time to take a deep look into it (I started with Ethereum because it is well documented and supported). By entrusting me your votes, I'll be able to fund my works with the mining rewards from notary node (NN) and speed up my contribution to Komodo. 

I don't have much experience in system security/administration, but I don't mind spend time learning from other NN operators in order to guarantee the performance of my NN.
 
```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
