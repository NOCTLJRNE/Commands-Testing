## :information_source: My profile and background

You can find my full background & profile on linkedin [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bao-an-pham-ho-b04814a3/. In short, I'm an electrical engineer who is currently working in France. After 3 years working for CEA (a French public government-funded research organisation), I decided to learn how to become a blockchain developper. 


## :question: Why vote for me ?

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
